    Calculate the azimuthally averaged radial profile.

    image - The 2D image
    center - The [x,y] pixel coordinates used as the center. The default is 
             None, which then uses the center of the image (including 
             fractional pixels).
    stddev - if specified, return the azimuthal standard deviation instead of the average
    returnradii - if specified, return (radii_array,radial_profile)
    return_nr   - if specified, return number of pixels per radius *and* radius
    binsize - size of the averaging bin.  Can lead to strange results if
        non-binsize factors are used to specify the center and the binsize is
        too large
    weights - can do a weighted average instead of a simple average if this keyword parameter
        is set.  weights.shape must = image.shape.  weighted stddev is undefined, so don't
        set weights and stddev.
    steps - if specified, will return a double-length bin array and radial
        profile so you can plot a step-form radial profile (which more accurately
        represents what's going on)
    interpnan - Interpolate over NAN values, i.e. bins where there is no data?
        left,right - passed to interpnan; they set the extrapolated values

    If a bin contains NO DATA, it will have a NAN value because of the
    divide-by-sum-of-weights component.  I think this is a useful way to denote
    lack of data, but users let me know if an alternative is prefered...
